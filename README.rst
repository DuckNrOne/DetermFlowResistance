Determination of the flow resistance
====================================
This program was used to determine flow resistance for a scientific project.
In order to determine the flow resistance, we have considered a construction
with which one can determine a certain angle.

Why you need the angle?
-----------------------
Given is a pipe with a sphere in the middle. This sphere is
connected to the pipe by a little rope. By adjusting
the flow speed, the angle between the rope and the pipe gets bigger or smaller.

To get the flow resistance you have to know this angle.

Determination of the resistance
-------------------------------
To understand the determination of the flow resistance and the dyamic buoyancy with the angle,
read this `Determination <https://github.com/DuckNrOne/DetermFlowResistance/blob/master/Determ.pdf>`_. (an english version is in production ;).

Things to know
---------------
Since it is a school project, the results are written in German.
If you ask or have any pointers to a line or a file, I would be glad
if you would open a new issue so that we can get into the conversation.
It does not matter if it was written in English or German.
